Commonly, it is used for communication, such as social media networking and emails, as well as the transfer of files and information, such as accessing a file on the cloud, or even viewing this website!

			<h1>HTML 5</h1>
			<p>HTML or Hyperlink Markup Language is the forms the basis of EVERY SINGLE website. Google web engine, Apple's online store, and even this very website all use HTML. Essentially, HTML can be defined as the publishing format for the web. Each and every HTML file is made up of many letters and words enclosed in triangular brackets, like these ones: &lt;&gt; There are two vital tags that all HTML code is built and created upon: the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, and the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. These enclosing tags show what is going to be in your website. The browser displays what is in your body and all that is contained within the head, however, the head is typically used for establishing titles, correctly setting-up the file, and links to other files you may reference in your HTML code. HTML also has parts to it, called elements. Elements within your code can be displayed through your browser using some other tags. Some tags include lexical content such as paragraphs, headings, and lists, whilst others open capability for media implementation.<br>&nbsp;</p>

			<h1>CSS</h1>
			<p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheet is a vital aspect of drawing attention to your webpage. It opens opportunities to uniquely customise the design of your website, to suit your taste or target field. Whilst it is essential to have content on your website that is informative, potential visitors may find the style unengaging or unappealing if it does not flow, or have a design that really 'dazzles'! Hence why it is important to have a build an informative AND attractive webpage. CSS coding allows the webpage to have a custom colour scheme, borders, fonts, positioning, sizing, and even shapes!<br>&nbsp;</p>
